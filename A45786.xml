            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I hope the mutual Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence we have in one another will eaſily free you from all unkind Suſpicions, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage you to uſe the ſame Freedom and Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with me on this as you have hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Number and Quality I will allow your Party, though perhaps not in that Degree that you imagin, it being very uſual to magnify both theſe above what is juſt: For if out of your Numbers we ſubſtract thoſe that are act<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed purely by their Intereſt, and thoſe that are impoſed upon by meer empty Shews and falſe Appearances, without ever examining the Truth of things; that is to ſay, thoſe that ſpeak otherwiſe than they think, and thoſe that do not think at all, neither of which can be much reckoned upon, the former not being truly yours, and the latter ſo unaccountably ſuch, that it is impoſſible you can be ſure of them; I ſay, if both theſe were ſcored off from your Party, you would have no great Reaſon to brag of their Number: And as for their Quality, I do not well underſtand in what Sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That the Church of <hi>England,</hi> at leaſt ſince the Reformation, has not laid Claim to an Infallibility, is ſo far from being any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to her, that it very much commends her Modeſty: But withal I would have you to conſider, that there is a very great Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between a Church's not claiming Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and a Church's owning her ſelf to have actually ſailed, eſpecially in propoſing the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Religion: For though there is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no Reproach in the former, yet there is a very great one in the latter, and a very great inconveniency too: For though a Church is not really Infallible, yet as long as ſhe inſiſts upon her not having actually erred. or that no ſuch thing can be made appear, I may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry confidently rely upon her Guideſhip; in ſuch a Caſe I am really as ſafe and may be as confident, as if ſhe pretended to an abſolute Infallibility; perhaps more, becauſe an Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility requires a blind Obedience to what it p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Since you own that he once had that Right, I conceive it is rather incumbent on you to ſhew how he has loſt it, than on me to prove that he has not loſt it; for that were to put me upon the Proof of a Negative, which in moſt caſes is very hard. Suppoſe I am not only actually but legally poſſeſſed of an Eſtate, and another comes and violently drives me from it; if afterward the Matter comes to he debated before a Judge in order to a Deciſion, it cannot reaſonably be demanded that I ſhould
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61752:4"/>prove my Title, becauſe it being acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been-good before he invaded it, it muſt be preſumed to be ſo ſtill, unleſs he can diſprove it: So that the proof muſt lie wholly upon him, and thoſe that are of Counſel for him, there being no more incumbent on me but only to anſwer thoſe Arguments by which he endeavours to prove that I have forfeited my Right. Juſt ſo it is in the Caſe now in Diſpute. So that to expect that I or any man elſe ſhould prove that King <hi>James</hi> has not loſt his Right, any otherwiſe than by diſproving thoſe Arguments by which your Party pretend to make it appear that he has loſt it, is both a very great Hardſhip upon us, and a very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous way of arguing.</p>

Yet partly becauſe I am very loath to venture upon ſo great an Undertaking; and partly becauſe I am very confident you would not be ſo obſtinate in maintaining King <hi>James</hi>'s Right, without ſome very good Reaſons, more than what are barely Negative or purely defenſive: I deſire you will be pleaſed to take the Proof upon you, though at the ſame time, I grant, you leave a more advantageous Poſt, and forgoe an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage you may juſtly claim.</p>

               <p>In confidence of that I will; and that I may reduce my Diſcourſe to as narrow a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs as may be there are two Things which I ſhall take for granted. Firſt, That K. <hi>James</hi> was once our True and Lawful King: That is to ſay, that by the Fundamental Laws of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy, He and He alone, was inveſted with the Lawful Right of governing theſe three Kingdoms and all other Dominions thereto annex'd, as undoubted Heir and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor to his Royal Brother. The Second Thing is neceſſarily conſequent upon that; namely, that having once had that Right, if he has nor loſt it ſince, he muſt needs have it ſtill. Theſe two Things being granted, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> only remains that I give you the Reaſons why I contend that he has not loſt that Right, at leaſt not by any Law or Juſtice; and for that, I think, there is no better Reaſon needs be given than what you your Selves furniſh us withal.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>However ſtrange it may ſeem to you, it is no leſs ſatisfactory to me, for the Reaſon I Intend to urge is the vaſt Difference among your Selves, nay, the abſolute Inconſiſtency of your <hi>Opinions,</hi> when you are put to it to declare how or by what means King <hi>James</hi> came to loſe his Right. That he has loſt it, I grant all of you agree, or at leaſt pretend ſo to do; but when we call upon you (as very reaſonably we may) to ſhew us how or by what means he loſt it, inſtead of a ſatisfactory Anſwer which all of you will ſtand by, we meer with nothing but meer Shifts and diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous Shuffling; ſome pretending one thing, and ſome another.

'Tis much of the ſame Nature with that Argument which is commonly urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Infallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> For however peremptory they are in laying Claim to it, yet inaſmuch as they cannot agree among themſelves where to fix it: Some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it in the Pope alone without a General Council: Some, in ſuch a Council without the Pope: And ſome, neither in one nor t'other apart, but conjunctly in both: That very Inconſiſtency of their Opinions is urged as an Argument that indeed there is no ſuch Thing among them; and a very good one it is too, at leaſt <hi>ad hominem.</hi> For though a Thing may otherwiſe have ſome Semblance of Truth, yet when they that Authoriſe it cannot agree among themſelves, but palpably contradict one another in their opinions about it, it muſt needs be a mighty Prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; and ſo it is in the Caſe now under Conſideration. However unanimous you may be in aſſerting that King <hi>James</hi> has loſt his Right, yet inaſmuch as you differ ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong your ſelves, when you come to declare how or by what means he loſt it, that it is impoſſible to reconcile you, it is a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Argument that indeed he has not loſt it, at leaſt that you your ſelves cannot ſo much a pretend to be aſſured of it.</p>

But however true this may be, I muſt tell you, it is nothing to the Purpoſe we were ſpeaking of: For you cannot but know, that the Subject of our Diſpute is not the bare loſing of a Thing it ſelf, but the loſing of ones Right or Title to it, which (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Thus you ſee what a Blundering you have made purely by miſtaking my Argument: I affirmed one thing, and you denied another: My Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is concerning the loſs of one's Right; and your Anſwer is concerning the loſs of what one has ſtill a Right to; which two are ſo far aſunder that they can never meet one another.</p>

               <p>The Truth is, I do now partly ſee my Miſtake.

               <p>I do not much care if I do: And in order to it, ſhall make Uſe of the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance you mentioned; that is, of a Man who having his Pocket well ſtored with Money, and being very well aſſured that it is his own, that no Man elſe can pretend any Right or Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to it, does on that Conſideration become more careleſs and ſecure than perhaps a wiſe Man ought to be, thinking no body would be ſo injurious as to offer to deprive him of it: By this means it ſo falls out, that this Money is loſt, and another Man is actually in Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. Now in this Caſe the Diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and me is not whether this Man has loſt his Money or not; of that I am no leſs ſenſible than you are: All the Diſpute is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Right and Title to it; Whether or not when he loſt his Money he did likewiſe loſe all Right and Title to it. If he did, I grant there is no Wrong done him, nor can be in Reaſon pretend to any thing of Reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But if not, I hope you will allow him to inſiſt upon his Right ſtill, and to do what he can to recover it, or rather to aſſert and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate it, for to ſpeak properly, what was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loſt can be ſaid to be recovered. This, I ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, Whether or not the Man in loſing his Money did really loſe all his Right and Title to it, is the only Thing in Diſpute between you and me, That which I have undertaken to prove is, That he has not loſt it, but ought ſtill to inſiſt upon it: The Argument I have urged for that Purpoſe is grounded on this Suppoſition, That when the Matter comes to be enquired into, they who maintain that he has loſt his Right are ſo far from making it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear how or by what means he loſt it, that their Opinions about it are not only very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, but indeed very inconſiſtent. The reaſon of the Conſequence is that common A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiom among the Lawyers, That <hi>de non apparenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus &amp; non exiſtentibus eadem eſt ratio,</hi> that is to ſay, That if a Thing does not appear to be, it is the ſame Thing in Law as if it were not: And if ſo, he that ſays ſuch a Man has not loſt h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Right, ſays no more than he that ſays it is not made appear he has loſt it. But the Force of this Argument does yet more fully appear, if we proceed a little further in this Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and bring the matter before a Judge.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:61752:6"/>
               <p>Let us then ſuppoſe both Parties to appear in Court, both he that has got Poſſeſſion of the Money, and he that ſtill claims a Right to it, together with their Friends and Followers, of which, you may be ſure, the former will have the far more numerous Train, for a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I ſhall not need mention: But it is no matter for that, there they both are, in order to have a Tryal; and as Loſers do uſually take a Liberty to talk the Plaintiff, or he that has loſt his Money, will be ſure to begin the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, by inſiſting on his Right and demanding Reſtitution: The Defendant is likewiſe very obſtinate in aſſerting his Right.</p>
               <p>How can that be? Says the Judge You cannot both have a Right to the ſame Money, in Oppoſition to one another, and that at the ſame time too. Who had the firſt Right?</p>
               <p>That had I (ſays the Plaintiff) and have been moſt notoriouſly injured in it.</p>
               <p>Truly (ſays the Defendant) I grant his Right was prior to mine, but he has ſo far loſt it to all Intents and Purpoſes that he cannot now in any Reaſon lay claim to it.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo? (ſays the Judge) Do you own that you have loſt that Right you formerly had?</p>
               <p>No (ſays the Plaintiff) I do utterly deny it, and dare him and his whole Party to prove it.</p>

Since then it is acknowledged by both Parties that the Plaintiff had the firſt Right to the Money in diſpute, I muſt tell you that are the Deſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, hardly to ſay that he has loſt that Right, is no Proof that he really has loſt it.

There are but very few ways by which a Man can forfeit it. And therefore, ſince it is granted that the Plaintiff had once a good Right to that Money, you that are of the Defendant's Side, muſt either make appear how or by what means he loſt that Right and Title, or otherwiſe you do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. Having thus given you what Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections I thought neceſſary, in order to put you into a right method of proceeding the more regularly, it only now remains that we examine what evidence they that are of the Defendants Side can bring againſt the Plaintiff to prove the loſs of his Right. Come then, you, honeſt Friend, that put your ſelf forward, you look as if you could make ſome Diſcovery of this Matter, What do you know of it?

               <p>Why, thus. This Man to my knowledg has the Money in his Pocket: How then can another Man have the Right to it? Can another Man have a Right to what I have in my Pocket? That were a good one indeed, for at that rate he may (for ought I know) pretend a Right to my Wiſe too; for if a Man cannot be ſure of that he has in his Pocket, he can be ſure of nothing. And beſides that, you your ſelf did very learnedly obſerve that both of them cannot have a Right to it at the ſame time.</p>

               <p>That (I muſt confeſs) is in my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion very ſtrange. Indeed if the Caſe had been thus; if that Money had been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that Man only by way of Truſt, and that upon ſuch Terms and Conditions, that it ſhould be applied only to ſuch and ſuch Uſes, particularly for the Benefit and Advantage of thoſe that had a dependance on him, and had you with ſome others been nominated in that Conveyance as Overſeers, and impower'd to call him to an account, in caſe theſe Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould not he duely perform'd. I ſay, if the Caſe had been thus, you had done no more in depriving him of his Right than what you might very well anſwer for, ſuppoſing the Charge which you have brought againſt him to be true. But for ought I can ſee, the Caſe was very much otherwiſe. Here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing made appear of any ſuch conditional Conveyance to this Man, nor any Perſons no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated to overſee, much leſs to controul him in the Management of it: On the contrary, you your ſelf own that all of you who were concerned in depriving this Man of his Right, were ſuch as had a dependance upon him and were under his Juriſdiction. Now, that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons thus ſtared ſhould take upon them not only to call him to an account whom they own to be their Superior, but likewiſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of his Right, is a thing ſo very ſtrange, that I muſt confeſs I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it. It is indeed a perfect Contradiction, for it ſuppoſes you to be under his Authority and to have a dependance upon him, and yet at the ſame time it ſubjects him to your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and makes him wholly to depend upon you; which two things let whoſo will recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile, for my part I cannot. I grant, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like this at leaſt in appearance may be agreed upon by an expreſs mutual Compact. As for example, <hi>B, C</hi> and <hi>D,</hi> may enter into Articles with <hi>A,</hi> and oblige themſelves that as long as <hi>A</hi> does duely and faithfully perform ſuch and ſuch Conditions, they will be ſubject to him and obey his Commands, but with this <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that <hi>A.</hi> ſhall likewiſe oblige himſelf, that in caſe he does not perform theſe Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he ſhall be accountable to them and lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be depoſed by them. In theſe and ſuch like Compacts there is ſome Reſerve of Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority ſtill good even to the Subjects, by which they may, in ſome Caſes, call thoſe to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, to whom they have conditionally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected themſelves: But to pretend to ſuch a Reſerve, or to challenge ſuch a Right in other Caſes, where no ſuch Compact is produced, not can be made appear ever to have been made, is <hi>Non-ſence</hi>

                  </gap> conſider that that Abſurdity, however great, is more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the Product of your own Principle than of the contrary: For when in caſe of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrongfully, you lay hold on that preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Right which you ſuppoſe to be allowed you by your imaginary Contract, and by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue thereof, not only call your Superior to an Account, but deprive him of all he has; that does not put an end to Suffering, which is the only End you propoſe to your ſelves in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to juſtify what you do: I ſay, the Courſe you take does not reach that End, it does not put an end to Suffering, but only transfers it from one to another; you take a very effectual Courſe (I grant) to put an end to your own Sufferings and to redreſs your own Grievances; but withal you little conſider, that at the ſame time you entail them on your ſuperior; and do what you can to cut him off from all poſſibility of Redreſs; for who ſhall put an end to his Sufferings? That your Sufferings might have couſed without taking any ſuch vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Courſe to put a ſtop to them, is much more probable (abſtracting from the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Inter poſitions of Divine Providence) than that his will do ſo: for it might much more reaſonably be expected, that if he had
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61752:7"/>ſeen you endure your Sufferings patiently, without murmuring or repining, he would have relented and reſtored you to your Rights and Priviledges, than it can be expected that you will reſtore him to his Right. The very fear of being called to an account by him, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to keep you from ever thinking of that, which yet could have been of no Force, nor have had any Influence on him in the other Caſe: so that if any Principle, muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be thought abſurd, becauſe they ſuppoſe or infer a Neceſſity of Suffering, without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing any means of Redreſs.

            <sp>

               <p>A Cure may well be ſaid to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, when the Remedy is worſe than the Diſeaſe; and ſuch was your Cure: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of taking away the Pain, which ought to have been done, and by regular Means might have been done, you by irregular Means, (like bulſy, ignorant Quacks, that are always pretending to what they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand) only drove it from one Place to another; from the outward and leſs ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Parts to the very Heart and Vitals, and by that Means rendred it more incurable than otherwiſe it could poſſibly have been, had it either been left to take it's Courſe, or fallen into diſcreeter Hands. But, as you ſay, your Buſineſs here is not to diſpute but to give E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; and therefore we will give you no farther Trouble. Let us now call another.

               <p>Sir, I very much wonder that there ſhould be any Diſpute in the Caſe: For whatever Right he might formerly have to that Money, I can aſſure you he has none now.</p>

               <p>To tell you the Truth. He gave away his Right; as ſoon as he found there was like to be a Diſpute about it, he very fairly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded from it, and voluntarily reſigned it up.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>If it was not done according to the uſual Form, you are obliged to give us an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count after what manner it was done; that being a very material Point, for you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps call that a Reſignation which indeed is not.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Third Evidence.</speaker>
               <p>The manner was thus: The Gentleman that had the Money very fairly went away and left it, retired himſelf into another Countrey, without giving any body the Truſt of it or ſo much as leaving any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders how it ſhould be diſpoſed of.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Third Evidence.</speaker>
               <p>Why, they that thought themſelves moſt nearly concerned to look after it and beſt knew his Temper, did ſo interpret Things that this his abrupt Departure from his Right was taken for an entire Reſignation of it: And accordingly they took upon them to diſpoſe of the Money, and gave it to him that now has it in Poſſeſſion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>Upon what Conſideration was that done? Had he done any thing to merit ſuch a Favour at their Hands?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Third Evidence.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, at their earneſt Deſire and upon their repeated Inſtances to him, he had done them a very important piece of Service.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>So, it ſeems he had done a Jobb of Journey-work for them, and they to ſave themſelves very fairly paid him with another Man's Money. Well, but was this Reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (you ſpeak of) free and voluntary? Was there nothing of Force or Conſtraint in the Matter?</p>

               <speaker>Third Evidence.</speaker>
               <p>I do not know what you may call Force, but we all think there was none. Indeed, as Matters then ſtood, he might think it ſafeſt for him to withdraw, but that he was forc'd ſo to do in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p>Methinks you ſpeak but very faintly of the Matter, and indeed the whole Progreſs of it ſeems ſo very unaccountable that I know not what to make of it: Pray tell us a little more plainly how it went.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Third Evidence.</speaker>
               <p>There had indeed been ſome Miſunderſtanding between theſe two Perſons, him that formerly had the Money, and him that now has it, before this Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made. He that now has the Money was then in the Neighbourhood with a very ſtrong Party, reſolving not to depart, till ſome Grievances (whereof he juſtly complained) ſhould be redreſſed. The other had likewiſe a very ſtrong Party with him, but finding that ſome of his Followers (whom he thought he had moſt reaſon to truſt, as having been moſt particularly obliged to him) did not only keep a ſecret Correſpondence with the other Party, but begin at laſt to go over in great Numbers to them, he, upon ſome Conſiderations beſt known to himſelf, reſolved to withdraw, which accordingly he did; and that is it which we call a reſigning up his Right.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, It is eaſy enough to ſee upon what Conſiderations it was done, for now you ſpeak plain. But is it poſſible you can believe there was nothing of Force in all this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Third Evidence.</speaker>
               <p>I believe his being treated after that manner I have mentioned might partly occaſion his Departure, and make it more abrupt and precipitant than otherwiſe he might have deſigned it: But that he was properly forced to it I do not ſee: For to force a Man to depart is to thruſt him out of Doors by Head and Shoulders, which was ſo far from being offered to him, that we did not ſo much as know of his Departure. There was indeed a ſort of Meſſage ſent, <hi>To remove from his Houſe,</hi> which ſome thought was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory enough: But what then? I hope there is a vaſt Difference between requiting a Man to leave his Houſe, and forcing him to leave the Kingdom.</p>

               <p>No, he has never returned ſince; for I am very ſure the Perſon that makes the Demand here in Court is not he himſelf, but one that appears for him. And as to the other part of the Queſtion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not they that took upon them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Money would admit of his Return to make ſuch a Demand, I am very confident they would not, becauſe I ſee they uſe all the Precautions they can to hinder it.</p>

               <speaker>Third Evidence.</speaker>
               <p>No, not ſo much afraid nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but I believe they are ſo wiſe as to think it worth their while to ſave the trouble of it if they can.</p>

               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>Well, I have but one Queſtion more to ask you, and that is, Whether or nor you know any thing of any other Money he had, beſides that we have been ſpeaking of, and what became of it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Third Evidence.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, he had another Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, which though it did properly belong to the ſame Sum, did yet lie in another remote Place. That indeed he did what he could to have ſaved, but all would not do; for in ſpight of all his Endeavours to the contrary, he that had received the reſt, with the aſſiſtance of thoſe that gave it him, wreſted it out of his Hands.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>I warrant you there was nothing of Force in that neither, if your Notion of it muſt be allowed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Third Evidence.</speaker>
               <p>Really I can ſay nothing as to that, for I was not upon the Place, and I do not love to ſay any thing but what I know to be true.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed, Sir, I think you have ſaid enough in all Reaſon, and accordingly you are diſmiſſ, and may return to your Place. You that ſtand next, Can you give us any ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Account of this Man's loſing his Right?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Fourth Evidence.</speaker>
               <p>That he has moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt it, I do fully agree with thoſe that have ſpoke before me; but as to the way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how or by what means he loſt it, I muſt confeſs my Opinion is very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ar different from theirs: For whereas one aſſerts, That he vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily gave up his Right: Another, That for very weighty Reaſons, they that were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe his Vaſſals and had a dependance upon him did utterly deprive him of it; I look upon both theſe Aſſertions as very extravagant and unaccountable; The one being ſo improbable, that I am ſure no wiſe Man will believe it; and the other ſo unwarrantable, that I am equally ſure no good Man will juſtify it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>Go on then, and tell us what's your Opinion of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fourth Evidence.</speaker>
               <p>My Opinion is, That by the abuſing of his Right he did actually forfeit it; for though I am very well ſatisfied, that let a man's Miſdemeanours be what they will, they that are under his Authority and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction cannot lawfully deprive him of his Right, without there be ſome Law to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant them in ſo doing, which, in the Caſe we now ſpeak of, neither is nor (I believe) can be produced: Yet that he may be guilty of ſuch Miſdemeanours, or of abuſing his Right to ſuch ill Purpoſes, as thereby abſolutely to forfeit it; and that in ſuch a Caſe, they that are moſt immediatly concern'd may take the Forfeiture, and diſpoſe of that Right as they ſhall think fit, I do not in the leaſt queſtion. I can ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in all this but what I think is very reaſonable: And I am very poſitive that by theſe Means it was that this Man loſt his Right.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhall not ask you what theſe Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours were, nor how clearly they were proved againſt him, for that were to engage our ſelves farther than at preſent is needful. The only Thing I want to know is, whether or not there be any expreſs Law or Statute concerning this Man's Caſe, wherein it is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and Enacted, That upon the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſuch or ſuch Miſdemeanours, what Right he had ſhould be abſolutely forfeited. If you can produce any ſuch Law, you are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much in the right in all you have ſaid: If not, you muſt give me leave to tell you, that you are as wide from the Truth, as any of thoſe whoſe Opinions you have rejected.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Fourth Evidence.</speaker>
               <p>The Truth is, I am not ſo very well vers'd in Law or Statute-Books
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61752:9"/>as to mention any expreſs Act of that nature, nor do I certainly know whether or not there be any that are incontravertibly ſuch; but this much I am very well aſſured of, that whatever may be it's Conſiſtency with the expreſs Letter of the Law, it is very conſonant and agreeable to Reaſon and Equity, which are the chief Ground and End of the Law.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Judge.</speaker>
               <p>The generality of Men are ſo very apt to be confident, even when they are in an Errour (eſpecially in thoſe things the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereof depends wholly upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their own Reaſon and Judgment, which is a thing very eaſily byaſſed) that I am afraid the Aſſurance you boaſt of will not amount to much, nor can it ſafely be relyed upon in a Matter of ſo great Importance, Not but that I agree with you, that Equity and Reaſon are the Ground and End of the Law: But that every Thing is agreeable to the Rules of Equity and Reaſon, which ſome are pleaſed to call ſo, however numerous or however confident they may be, that (I muſt confe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Indeed if all Men were ſo ingenuous as not to call any thing juſt and reaſonable but what they really think ſo to be, and like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

This great Defect both of Diſcretion and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in a great part of Mankind, as it cannot chooſe but be very obvious to thoſe that are daily converſant among them; ſo it is that which has not only given Riſe to, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe inferred a Neceſſity of that multiplicity of Laws which we now have. They whoſe Buſineſs it is to prepare Laws, and they whoſe Priviledge is to ſtamp them or give Life and Value to them, did very plainly foreſee, that though there is ſuch a Thing as Equity and Reaſon antecedent to any Law, yet Men are ſo very apt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

Of this we have a very remarkable Inſtance in the Hiſtory or Trial of <hi>Suſannah,</hi> which (though it is cut off by ſome from the Book of <hi>Daniel's</hi> Prophecies, as not being found in the Original, and therefore not to be urged as Canonical Scripture, yet) is of greater Authority than any Inſtance we can borrow from later Ages. The Caſe was thus: Suſannah <hi>was accuſed of a Crime which by the Law was Death: The witneſſes againſt her were two Elders, who among the</hi> Jews <hi>were Men of very great Credit and Authority, and accordingly upon their Evidence ſhe was condemned to Death: But as ſhe was led out to the place of Execution,</hi> Daniel <hi>Being greatly ſuſpicious that they had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed her falſly, or rather by ſome Divine Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aſſured of it, was very zealous to ſave her; and in order to it did ſo far prevail with the whole Aſſembly, who (it ſeems) did very much pity her, that they all returned to the place of Judgment, to enquire more diligently into the Matter.</hi> Daniel <hi>would needs examine the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes himſelf, and the better to make appear how villainouſly they had conſpired againſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I do remember that at laſt the Judge did ſay ſomething of that nature; for after he had ſumm'd up the Evidence, he made ſome Reflections upon the Witneſſes differing from one another, alledging, That that very Difference was enough to invalidate their Teſtimony, and convince them of Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood: But methought he was very hard put to it when he took his Proof out of the <hi>Apocrypha.</hi>

               <p>What he mentioned out of the <hi>Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> was not to prove what he had ſaid, but only to illuſtrate it; for indeed it does not ſtand in need of any Proof, it being the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Practice of all Courts to reject all Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that is parched up of Inconſiſtencies, or when the Perſons that give it contradict one another, But ſuppoſe it did need a Proof and that the Story he mentioned was deſign'd for an Argument, I do not ſee any Abſurdity in it at all, except you will ſay that no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is good but what is contained in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And even in that Caſe it is no very hard matter to have found one every way as much to his Purpoſe as that he mentioned. I hope <hi>Mark 14th</hi> is not <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> Do but peruſe that Chapter from <hi>verſe</hi> 55, and tell me your Opinion of it. There you will ſind, that in the Trial of our bleſſed Saviour, though the Chief Prieſts and all the Council did mightily beſtir themſelves to find Witneſs againſt him to put him to Death, yet they could make nothing of it; not but that there were a great many that did witneſs againſt him, but the Miſchief of it was, they were all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as falſe Witneſſes, their Teſtimony could not be relied upon; and the Reaſon of it is there expreſſed, namely, becauſe their Witneſſes agreed not together. It ſeems they contradicted one another in their Evidence, ſo that no Sentence of Condemnation could be grounded upon it; until at laſt they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he ſpoke Blaſphemy in their own hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and upon that he was condemned.

Theſe their contradictory Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of it are the chief Thing I have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to urged as an Argument that indeed he has not loſt it. You may likewiſe remember that my bringing in of that Trial was to confirm and enforce that Argument: In order to which as it was abſolutely neceſſary ſo to ſtate the Caſe of the Plaintiff, that as near as could be it might be anſwerable to that of K. <hi>James,</hi> ſo it was no leſs neceſſary that there ſhould be the ſame Inconſiſtency in their Evidence who pretend to give an account how the one loſt all Right and Title to his Money, as there is among thoſe who pretend to give an account how the other loſt all Right and Title to his Three Kingdoms. That I have managed the Trial to, I am not at all to blame; for without that it would have been nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſince to argue from one Caſe to another, when there is no Exactness of Parity between them, muſt needs be very inconcluſive.

               <p>I very well underſtand what you would be at, but am confident you are in a Miſtake, for when Witneſſes diſagree in their Evidence in any material Point, eſpecially if their De poſitions be ſo irreconcileable that they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove one another, it ſignifies nothing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Diſagreement be only between ſingle Perſons or conſiderable Numbers; for ten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ten is the ſame thing in Proportion as one againſt one. Let us ſuppoſe one Man to be accuſed o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61752:12"/>whereof he inſtantly died. I grant theſe 2 or 3 Witneſſes thus concurring in their Evidence are ſufficient in Law to affix the Guilt upon him, if there be no other Evidence to interfere with theirs; but that either the Judge ſhould immediately upon that charge the Jury with it, or they give in their Verdict without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the matter any farther, would at beſt be very raſh, and perhaps a very unjuſt thing: For it may ſo fall out that the next two or three that are examined, may as poſitively declare, That the way he murdered him was by ſhooting him through the Head with a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol. Some perhaps will obſtinately affirm, That he knock'd him on the Head with a Hatchet. And others as ſtiffly maintain, that he cut his Throat with a Byoner. In ſuch a Caſe, though all the Witneſſes do unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree in this, That the Perſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

I appeal to your ſelf, whether that Inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Evidence does not utterly overthrow it, and render it ſo uncertain that nothing can be made of it, And yet you ſee there are no leſs than 2 or 3 Witneſſes atteſting every Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. Nay. If inſtead of Three you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to be Threeſcore or three Hundred, it will be the ſame Caſe ſtill; ſo long as there is a proportionable or even a conſiderable Number whoſe Atteſtation is utterly inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with theirs.</p>

               <p>I cannot deny but that when Witneſſes diſagree in their Teſtimony, eſpecially if they contradict one another, it very much leſſens their Credit if not quite invalidates their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: And accordingly I do very freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the Difference among thoſe of our Party, in giving an Account how or by what means King <hi>James</hi> came to loſe his Right, is no ſmall Prejudice to our Cauſe; becauſe many are apt to conclude as you do. that while ſome ſay one Thing and ſome ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there is nothing of certainty in the whole: On which Account it were heartily to be wiſhed, that all of us were of one Opinion in this Matter, at leaſt that theſe different O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions were not ſo publickly authoriſed as we ſee they are. But though I am thus free in granting the Diſadvantage we lye under, or the Prejudice our Cauſe ſuſtains by our ſo much differing in our Opinions; yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree to the Inference you de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> from it, namely, that becauſe the ſeveral Accounts we give of this Matter do very much differ from one another, therefore they are all to be rejected: There, I think, you run too faſt. I grant they cannot all be true, nor perhaps any two of them; but to conclude perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, that becauſe they are different therefore they are every one of them falſe, is to ſtrain the Premiſes a little too hard. For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all you have yet ſaid, one of them may very well be true; though at the ſame time, I confeſs it is a very hard matter to know which is it.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>In this Reply you confound Things that ought to be diſtinguiſhed; for you take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting a Thing as falſe to be all one and the ſame as if it were certainly known to be ſuch, when yet in many Caſes there is a great Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them; for the one may be when there is no neceſſity of the other: As in the former Example, it is not impoſſible but that one of the Particulars atteſted by the Witneſſes might have been true, as the one Man's cutting the other Man's Throat Let us ſuppoſe that it was really ſo: In that Caſe I grant that no Contradiction of other Witneſſes can prove their Evidence to be falſe; but withal you muſt likewiſe grant me that in the former Example it is ſo expreſly contradicted by ſeveral other Witneſſes, who for ought that appears are of no leſs Credit, that let it be never ſo true, it lies under no leſs Suſpicion of being falſe than any of the other Depoſitions, and conſequently is equally to be rejected as ſuch; for however true a Thing may be, it ſignifies nothing in Law without it be made appear ſo to be, and moſt certain it is that no Truth can be ſaid to be made appear when the Evidence for it is no more than is againſt it, or when it has no better Proofs to ſupport it than what are equally urged for a Falſhood. Now to apply this to what is in diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and me; I do not ſay that becauſe you differ very much among your Selves in giving an account how King <hi>James</hi> loſt his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61752:12"/>Right, therefore every one of theſe Accounts muſt needs be utterly falſe, no, all I inter from the Inconſiſtency of theſe Accounts, is that there can be no certainty that any of them is true, that all of them lie under a ſtrong Suſpicion of being falſe, and that no Man can have any tolerable Satisfaction but that they really are ſo. In a Word, that whatever Truth there may be in any of them it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to find where it is, and conſequently unreaſonable to lay any Streſs upon it. This is all I contend for as the neceſſary Conſequent of what has been hitherto urged, and this alone is enough for my purpoſe; for from hence it will appear to all conſidering Men, that your Parry in declaring King <hi>James</hi>'s Right to be loſt, and his Throne vacant, and ſetting up another in his Place, have acted the moſt unaccountably and unjuſtly that can be imagin'd: For what greater Injuſtice can there be, than firſt to declare his Throne va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, and then to diſpute among your Selves afterwards how it came to be ſo? Firſt to transfer his Right to another, and then ſet your Selves at work to find out Pretences to juſtify it? This is like condemning a Man firſt and then trying him afterward, which is ſuch a piece of Iniquity as (I think) is ſeldom heard of but in Jeſt.</p>

               <p>This Argument of yours you have urged not only much longer but indeed much far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than I at firſt expected, and therefore to avoid being tedious I ſhall make no more Replies to it. The Subſtance of it is, that though all they that are for the ſupport of the preſent Government do unanimouſly affirm that King <hi>James</hi> had loſt his Right, yet when they are put to it to declare how or by what means he loſt it, the Accounts they give of it are ſo very different that there is no poſſibility of reconciling them: From which difference of Opinions you Infer that no Man can have any tolerable Satisfaction of the Truth of what is pretended, and conſequently that they who upon ſuch looſe, inconſiſtent and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Evidence did take upon them to declare King <hi>James</hi>'s Throne vacant and transfer his Right to another, have done him a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable Injury. This I take to be the Subſtance of your Argument, concerning which I ſhall ſay no more at preſent, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to retain it in my Memory that when I have leiſure I may the more ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.

               <p>You may remember that when you firſt put it upon me to prove King <hi>James</hi>'s Right and Title to the Crown to be ſtill good, I told you what was properly incumbent on me was not directly to prove but only to defend it, for which all that is requiſite is only to anſwer thoſe Arguments by which thoſe of your Party endeavour to overthrow it; ſo that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or argumentative part ought in reaſon to have been yours and not mine. However up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your declining of it, I did (though with ſome Reluctancy) undertake it, but with this <hi>Proviſo</hi> that you ſhould expect no other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments from me than what the nature of the Thing in diſpute would bear, which I muſt tell you can be but very few: For ſuppoſing the Thing to be true, I know no other way to prove it but only theſe two. Firſt by ſhewing that they who aſſert the contrary are ſo ſtrangely divided in their Opinions that no Man can tell what they would be at, which I preſume is already done. The other way, and indeed the only remaining way by which it can be proved that King <hi>James</hi>'s Right to the Crown is yet ſtill good (even on Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that it really is ſo) is by diſmounting thoſe Batteries that you have raiſed againſt it: That is by examining and diſproving the ſeveral Pretences upon which thoſe of your Party give out that he has loſt his Right; Which if it can be done will go nigh to put an end to the whole Diſpute.</p>

This is ſo very true, that I may ſafely challenge you to give me an Inſtance of any one King now reigning, or perhaps that reigned for ſome Ages paſt. whoſe Subjects do not, or did not, complain of Grievances and Male-Adminiſtrations in their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>If ſo, we had better have no Kings at all, but put our ſelves under ſome other Form of Government: For that we ſhould be ſo obſtinately tenacious of ſuch a Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as you your ſelf acknowledge very rarely has been, and very hardly can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from Errour, is moſt unreaſonable.</p>

               <p>This Objection I plainly foreſaw and thought to have anticipated, if you had not prevented me, by telling you, that however plauſible that Propoſition of yours <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, nothing would be gained by it; For though it were in our power to change the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61752:14"/>to what Form we pleaſe (as moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is not, at leaſt not without the Conſent of the Governour) whatever Exchange we made, we ſhould find our ſelves loſers by the Bargain, ſince it may eaſily be made appear, that all other Forms of Government, as they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the reſult of Neceſſity than of Choice, ſo they are ſo far from being better ſecured from Errours and Miſtakes than that of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> that they are much more ſubject to them: So that your Objection againſt what I former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid concerning the Errours and Miſtakes incident to Kingly Government, is indeed the very ſame as if you ſhould thus reply to what I but now ſaid, That ſince all Sorts of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, have their Failings and Defects, the beſt way is to be under none at all; than which nothing can be more unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it being obvious to all wiſe and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men, that the worſt Form of Government in the World, even Tyranny it ſelf, is far more eligible and leſs hurtful than to be under none at all. Theſe things are ſo very plain, that without inſiſting any further upon them I ſhall return to what I was ſaying when your Objection interrupted me, namely, that it is ſuch a caſual Thing for Kings, as well as other Governours, to give their Subjects occaſion to complain of Miſcarriages and Male-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations in their Government, that perhaps it will be very hard to inſtance any one King that has not done it: So that if we may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to take that Courſe mentioned in the former Pretence, we may even bid adieu to all Government: For no man can chooſe but ſee, that if in all ſuch Caſes Subjects may war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably dethrone their Kings and ſet up o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in their ſtead, there can be no ſuch thing as Government, but the whole World muſt be filled with Confuſion. I grant, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medying a great Inconveniency ſome Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may be born with, if it be ſuch as we may reaſonably expect will ſoon be over, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but fair Sun-ſhine to follow. But alas! the Confuſions introduced by ſuch a Courſe as we now ſpeak of are of a far different Nature; being ſuch as we can never have any Proſpect of putting an end to, any otherwiſe than by letting ſall that Courſe: For it ſeldom fails but that they who change either their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Governour, on Pretence of having their Grievances redreſſed, ſind themſelves in a worſe ſtate at laſt than they were in at firſt, whereof it were eaſy to give an Inſtance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going far from home. But though I am thus free in granting that all Kings may be guilty, nay, that moſt Kings really are guilty of ſuch Errours and Miſtakes in Government as their Subjects think they have juſt reaſon to complain of as great Grievances, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that King <hi>James</hi> was ſo in ſeveral reſpects, yet I am very far from thinking, that all Complaints of that nature, either againſt him or any of the reſt are well grounded. I very well know, that it is uſual in all ſuch Caſes, not only to aggravate what is indeed true, but alſo to alledg what is really falſe. This in the Caſe of King <hi>James</hi> is very plainly to be ſeen: For you cannot chooſe but know, that the moſt clamorous Objections againſt him, and what moſt alienated the Hearts and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his Subjects from him were eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe Two: Firſt, That notwithſtanding the Birth of the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was nothing elſe but a meet Impoſture, yet King <hi>James</hi> endeavoured to obtrude him on theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms as his Right Heir, to the diſinheriting of his own lawful Children. Secondly, That he had privately entered into a Treaty with the <hi>French</hi> King to root out the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and ſet up the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Religion in theſe three Kingdoms, which was to be done by the Help and Aſſiſtance of the <hi>French King.</hi> Theſe, I moſt confeſs, had been great Grievances in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, enough to have ſhaken a more ſteady Loyalty than that of his Subjects, had they been as plainly proved as they were impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently alledged: But that no ſuch Proof has been made, nor ſo much as offered to be made, you your ſelf cannot but know. Never was any thing of that nature aſſerted with more Confidence or more induſtriouſly obtruded on Mens Belief. than theſe two Things I have mentioned, for whoever did but doubt of the Truth of them were told with all the Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance imaginable, that if once the P. of <hi>O.</hi> were but landed and the Repreſentatives of the Nation had Freedom and Leiſure to enquire into the Matter, the proof of theſe Things would be made as clear as the Sun at Noon-day.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61752:15"/>And yet you ſee that all theſe fine Pretences are now come to nothing. The Evidence you ſo much boaſted of then is now wholly on the other Side, it having ſufficiently appear'd ſince that King <hi>James</hi> was ſo far from treating privately with the <hi>French King</hi> for the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Forces to deſtroy our Religion, that he could not be perſuaded to accept of theſe Forces to reſiſt the Unnatural Invaſion of his Son-in-Law, but choſe rather to confide in the Courage and Loyalty of his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.

It cannot then be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that their forbearing to prove, or ſo much as to examine theſe Things, was out of any Reſpect to him, nor is it credible that any other Account can be given of it, but only this: They were afraid that a diligent Search and Enquiry into theſe Things would make a very different Diſcovery from what they had all along made the World expect, or that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of making them more evident than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, it would render them much more ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: Than which there needs no plainer Demonſtration, not only that theſe Things are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

The Convention did not go that way to work: So far were they from aſſuming any Power or Authority over the King's Perſon, ſo as to call him to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and judicially to depoſe him, that they did not in the leaſt pretend to it, nor ſo much as mention it, but went upon a quite differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Ground, as is very well known.

               <p>Very right: But that I can eaſily prove, both becauſe there is no Law for it, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe becauſe there are expreſs Laws againſt it. <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſay, There is no Law or Statute that the Subjects or People of <hi>England</hi> can in any Caſe depoſe or dethrone their Lawful King. This being a Negative Propoſition it cannot be expected that I ſhould prove it. It lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Party (at leaſt thoſe of them that ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelves under this Pretence) not only to produce ſuch a Law, but to make it appear, that it has never yet been repealed; till which time the Propoſition will ſtand good againſt them, 'Tis true Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> in his Argument does mention ſuch a Statute, and lays the greateſt Streſs of his Argument upon it, and yet confeſſes afterward, that whatever there might be formerly, there is no ſuch Thing now to be found; which is enough for my purpoſe, becauſe not to be found, and not to be in being, are the ſame Thing in Law. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> As there is no Law to warrant or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe the Depoſition of any of our Rightful Kings, ſo there are expreſs Laws againſt it.

I anſwer, That to dethrone a King is a degree of Rebellion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any thing mentioned in theſe Acts: For the reaſon why Subjects do aſſume to themſelves a coercive power over their King, or pretend to take up Arms or levy War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him is that by theſe means they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne him: And if ſo, it muſt needs be g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

It only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains that we examine what is grounded upon theſe Grievances, which is no leſs than King <hi>James</hi>'s forfeiting all his Right and Title to his three Kingdoms; which however con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently aſſerted, may as eaſily be diſproved, if either Law or Reaſon may be admitted as Judge. As for Law, I do not ſee it is ſo much as alledged: For although it might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably enough be expected, that they who take upon them to declare, that in caſe of Male-Adminiſtration a King forfeiteth his Crown, ſhould ſhew ſome expreſs Law, or Statute, or Act of Parliament by which it is ſo enacted. They have not yet been able to do it; and indeed how ſhould they, when there is no ſuch Statute to be found? They may well pretend to find ſome ſuch Clauſe in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Contract between the King and People, which when they are ſo kind as to produce we ſhall moſt willingly ſubmit to its Deciſion of the Controverſy; but that any ſuch Clauſe is to be found in any ſubſequent Statute is ſcarce to be imagined: For you very well know we never had any but what was made ſo by the King, that a Vote or Bill in Parliament though paſt in both Houſes, is of no Force or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity till ſign'd by him; it is he only that gives it the force of a Law. And do you think it probable that any King that is actually and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally in Poſſeſſion of a Crown, and is to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ſame to his Poſterity, ſhould of his own accord make a Law that in caſe of Male-Adminiſtration either by himſelf or by any of his Heirs and Succeſſors that Crown ſhould be forfeited? No doubt, Parliaments always have been and yet are inclinable enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare ſuch Bills, if they had any hopes of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in them; but that any King ſhould give the Royal Aſſear to them is not in any reason to be expected, for that were to looſen the Bonds of his own Government, and deliver both it and himſelf up as a Prey to the reſtleſs and unruly Multitude, who, if once ſuch a Door were unbolted, would always find Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences enough to puſh it open. But this is not all. Beſides that there is no Law to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port this Pretence, there are expreſs Laws to overthrow it. Thoſe very Statutes I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready quoted againſt depoſing of Kings from their Right may be no leſs pertinently alledged againſt their forfeiting of it: For as no King can be depoſed but by Force, ſo neither can it be expected that ever he will own his having forfeited his Right but by Force. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore ſince by theſe Statutes it is declared to be unlawful to take up Arms or levy War againſt the King, or to aſſume any Coercive Power over him, they are no leſs pleadable againſt this Pretence than they are againſt the former.</p>

               <p>I confeſs your Arguments againſt both the former Pretences are ſo very ſpecious and plauſible, that they deſerve to be ſeriouſly conſidered, which, I promiſe you, they ſhall be how ſoon I can have a convenient Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: Only at preſent give me leave to ask you a Queſtion or two, and then, if you pleaſe, you may proceed. You ſay it cannot be made appear by any Law or Statute, that in caſe of Miſ-Government or Male-Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration the King does either forfeit his Right, or is lyable to be depoſed by the People; and perhaps it may be ſo, becauſe, as you have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, whatever Reaſons any Parliament might have had to have promoted ſuch a Bill, it is not at all likely that any King would have Signed it. But what do you ſay of the King's Coronation-Oath? Does not that lay an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpensable Obligation upon him not to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his Subjects? Does he not ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and ſwear in that Oath, <hi>That he will go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern according to Law? That he will maintain their Religion, their Liberties and Properties en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, without making any Encroachment upon them.</hi>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I grant he does; but what then? Will it therefore follow, that it he does not exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perform theſe Things he forfeits his Right, or is accountable to his People? If you can find any ſuch Clauſe in that Oath it will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſerviceable to your Cauſe, but if not, it will ſignify nothing. It is very well known, that our Kings do immediately ſucceed to the Crown upon the Death of him that reigned laſt. That whoever does lineally ſucceed, is to all Intents and Purpoſes as truly and fully King, and has the ſame Right to the Duty and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance of his Subjects, before he takes that Coronation-Oath as afterward. It is neither
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61752:18"/>the proclaiming nor crowning of him that makes him King. Such Solemnities (I grant) are cuſtomarily uſed upon any new King's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the Throne, but his Right or Title cannot be ſaid to depend upon either of them, it being indeed antecedent to both. And as his Right to govern is prior to his Coronation, ſo is the Obligation he lies under to govern according to Law, to conſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

But it were needleſs to inſiſt upon this Matter; for whenceſoever it proceeds that the King is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to govern by Law, it will ſignify nothing to your purpoſe, unleſs you can make appear, that in ſubmitting to that Obligation he did likewiſe oblige himſelf, That in caſe he did not act conform<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

Nay, more than that, I allow that when a King does miſgovern or oppreſs his People, they who are of greateſt Eminency and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority among them, ought to interpoſe as far as they can, not by influencing Popular Inſurrections, not by inſolent and arrogant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances, nay, nor by ſaucy and unmannerly Petitions (all which do rather exaſperate than mollify the Hearts of Princes (but by meekly and humbly repreſenting to him the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies and ill Conſequences which muſt need attend ſuch irregular Meaſures, Such as looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Joints and ſhaking the Pillars of his Government, loſing the Hearts and Affections of his beſt Subjects, depopulating of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61752:19"/>Ambition and Revenge of any Favourite in particular. But if our King ſhould be ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, or we ſo unhappy, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that, there is yet no Redreſs of our Grievances; our next Recourſe muſt be, not to Arms, but to Almighty God by earneſt Prayer and Supplication, that ſince the Hearts of Kings are in a ſpecial Manner in his Hands, and that as the Rivers of Waters he turns them which way he pleaſes, he would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to incline our King's Heart ſo to govern, that the Advancement of his Glory and the Good of his Subject may be chiefly aimed at: And particularly that God would put it into his Heart to pity the Groans and redreſs the Grievances of thoſe that are oppreſſed.

That is a Courſe was never practiſed but by the worſt of Men and in the worſt of Ages. What can we ſay for our Selves when we conſider what we have done, and compare it with what in the like Caſes has been none in former Ages? For all the Out cry we have made againſt King <hi>James</hi>'s Tyranny, we had not yet reſiſted unto Blood, as many have done before us, in adhering to Religion. I need not go to far as the Primitive Times of Chriſtianity for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents of Loyalty and Submiſſion even under the moſt bloody Perſecutions, to confront and ſhame our preſent Practice; let us but reflect upon the Circumſtances we were in during Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign. What Proſpect was there of Peoples being eaſed of their ſufferings then? They were then actually under thoſe Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions which we were only afraid of, and had far leſs probability of Deliverance; and yet you ſee God Almighty did ſoon put an end to them. Yes, I ſay, he did it, and not they themſelves, for rather than deliver themſelves by any treacherous or rebellious Practices from theſe Perſecutions, they reſolved patiently to endure them expecting Relief from none but God: In which they were not diſappointed, for in Compaſſion of their Suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Which way God Almighty will bring it about he does not decide, nor will it become us to enquire, but that he will do it one way or other he makes no Queſtion, and in that Confidence reſolves never to ſhrink from his Loyalty, whatever he may ſuffer.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61752:20"/>not it was voluntary: For that a Man's with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing himſelf from his Houſe, or his Eſtate, or any thing elſe he has a Right to, ſhould be interpreted to be a yielding up of his Right, though at the ſam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

They were forced from their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches by the Rabble, ſo terribly threatned and cruelly uſed that they were compelled to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw for the Safety of their Lives; and yet the <hi>Convention</hi> were ſo far from puniſhing the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or reſtoring thoſe poor diſtreſſed Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to their Livings, that they interpreted that their forced Departure from them to be a culpable deſerting of them, and ſo placed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in their room. A thing ſo ſtrangely ſcandalous and reproachful, eſpecially by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made a National Act, that I can ſcarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they would ever have ventured upon it, had not you encouraged them to it by your Example. It was you that led the way, for they thought it no Reproach to treat their Clergy as you had treated your King.</p>

You very well know, that he made all the Preparation poſſible to oppoſe the Prince's Party, that in order to fight him he appear'd at the Head of an Army, who had they been but willing were able e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have chaſtiſed his Unnatural Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and ſent him back to the place from whence he came.

               <p>I cannot forbear telling you, that your charging him with deſerting his Army is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly diſingenuous: For you cannot chooſe but know, that before he left the Army a great part of them had moſt baſely and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly deſerted him. In a word, thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Perſons who had the Honour either of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt nearly related to him, or moſt high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preferred by him, and conſequently, whom he thought he might moſt ſafely confide in, as being moſt obliged to ſtand by him; thoſe very Perſons. I ſay, did moſt ſhamefully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him, not only by having deſignedly and induſtriouſly corrupted as many of the Army as they could before-hand, and prepared them for a Revolt, but by taking the firſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity they could to go over to the Prince, and aſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t him with their Counſell and what Forces they could carry over. Being thus baſely ſerved by thoſe whom he thought he had moſt Reaſon to truſt, what better Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could he in Reaſon expect from others; or indeed to rely upon the Fidelity of any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him? Not but that I grant ſome were faithful to him, and ſtood by him to the laſt; but beſides that theſe were but few, the baſe Treachery of ſome had rendered the Fidelity even of the reſt ſo doubtful and ſuſpected, that there was no way to know it but by the Event, and conſequently, it could not but be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61752:20"/>very unadviſable to hazzard a Battle upon the Confidence of it, his Cauſe being too good to be ventur'd upon ſuch a deſperate Puſh, as enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Enemy at ſuch a Diſadvantage maſt needs have been. On theſe Conſiderations, no reaſonable man can blame his Conduct in leaving his Army, having no Aſſurance of his own Safety in it; eſpecially having been told, by ſome who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> had Reaſon enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That there was a Deſign in hand to ſeize upon his Perſon, and deliver him up to the Prince. This (whether true or falſe) could not but ſeem highly probable to him, many of them having already given ſufficient Proofs, that they were capable even of the greateſt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies. And how far the Poiſon and Infection had ſpread it ſelf, no Man could tell. Thus was he forced from his Army by the Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Defection of thoſe who lay under the greateſt Obligations to defend him. I need not much enlarge upon what followed after that: It is but too well known, that <hi>White-Hall</hi> it ſelf was no ſafe Retreat for him; for though he propoſed to ſettle all Differences, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs all Grievances, by an amicable Treaty, the Prince would not ſo much as hear of it, but confined him who brought the Meſſage, and ſtill advanced in a warlike Poſture, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by that Means to frighten him away: But fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               <p>I muſt confeſs if things were as you have repreſented them, his withdrawing himſelf out of the Kingdom cannot properly be ſaid to have been voluntary, nor fairly interpreted to be an Abdication of the Government: But I would have you to know that they of our Party give a quite different account of it, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us that King <hi>James</hi> might have ſtayed if he had pleaſed, that his Life was in no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that he did not go away for fear of that, but becauſe he was afraid or aſham'd of being brought to a Tryal, wherein he might well foreſee he ſhould be accuſed of ſeveral horrid Crimes, from which it was impoſſible for him to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p>The account I have given is all plain matter of Fact groan led upon undeniable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, but that which you have given is made up of nothing elſe but impudent and malicious Calumnies, grounded on meer Surmiſes and unreaſonable Suſpicions of purpoſe to render him odious to his People, and confirm them in their Rebellion againſt him, wherein Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, for the Sins of the Nation, has hitherto curs'd you with Succeſs. You ſay he might have ſtayed if he had pleaſed, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you mean at his Peril, and then I join with you, for in that Senſe I believe he may return too if he pleaſes; but whereas you ſay that his Life was in no danger, I muſt confeſs I an not of your Opinion. I believe indeed the P. would ſcarce have made any attempt upon his Life at that time, at leaſt not directly, which vet is not to be imputed to any filial Duty or Reſpect, but rather to the Suſpicions he had, that it would diſguſt the People, by whoſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Favour he expected to compaſs his Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Deſigns: For though he knew them to be ſtrangely incenſed againſt their King, he was
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61752:21"/>afraid withal, that they were not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buuch'd to that heighth as not to be ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the murther of him: And for that Reaſon it was, that rather than detain him a Priſoner (which he might have done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

But however far that Politick Conſideration might reſtrain the Prince from attempting any thing againſt his Life at that time, it could not in Reaſon be expected that it would be of any long Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, partly becauſe great care was taken to extinguiſh thoſe ſmall Remains of Duty and Loyalty that were leſt among the People to their King: And partly becauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Life was in danger or not, as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for us certainly to decide, ſo it is not very material to diſpute, Moſt certain it is, that he himſelf was very apprehenſive of it, and it is no leſs certain, that he had a great deal of Reaſon ſo to be, and therefore did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry adviſedly (as Affairs then ſtood) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Or if ſuch a thing could have been, he had no reaſon to be either afraid or aſham'd of it, ſince he knew himſelf to be ſo innocent that even his greateſt Enemies could accuſe him of nothing, but what he either could very eaſily diſprove or was very willing to rectify. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

So far are you from being able to make theſe Sham-Pretences paſs with me, that I can never he perſuaded you your ſelves believe them. No, no, Such ſly Inſinuations are ſuggeſted only to amuſe the Vulgar, and may perhaps take with the unthinking Multitude, whom you manage with all the Art you can, as being the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Support of your Government, but to

Such a Deputation was neither practicable at that time, nor would it have ſerved to any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter purpoſe than only to have exaſperated them ſo much the more againſt him, and given them a freſh Occaſion of trampling upon his Authority. And as to that part of your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that his leaving you deſtitute of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, by withdrawing himſelf, did lay a Neceſſity upon you, either of ſetting up a new Governour to ſupply that Defect, or to live in Anarchy.

Some indeed are very poſitive that it was ſo, but others ſtickle as hard againſt it: And beſides that, it is far from being the Opinion of the Perſons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that have taken the Government upon them; for it cannot be expected that ever they will content themſelves with ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious Title as that comes to. But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> there is yet a worſe Thing in it; for if that Opinion be true, there was ſuch an eſſential
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61752:22"/>Errour and Defect in the Election of theſe Perſons, as makes the Choice it ſelf void and null. The Caſe is plainly thus: If the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was entirely diſſolved and a new one to be ſet up, it was but reaſonable that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular Man ſhould have a Vote in it; for ſince by my ſubmitting to a Government, when I am abſolutly Maſter of my ſelf (which I muſt be allowed to be in the Caſe now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) I do diveſt my ſelf of all the Right I have, and transfer it by way of Truſt upon the Governour, at leaſt ſo far as the Ends and Exigencies of the Government ſhall require it, and that ſo unreſervedly that I can never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke it afterward, it was abſolutely neceſſary that it be done by my own free and expreſs Conſent: For there can be no Reaſon why one Man's Right ſhould be given away by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Man's Vote, except there be ſome po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Law for it, which is not at all plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The other Senſe of it is this, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding King <hi>James</hi>'s Abdication, the whole ancient Frame of the Government was leſt entire, only he had departed from his Right to it, and made way for another to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him, as if he had been removed by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Death.

Indeed if the Perſon that is next in Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion be at ſome conſiderable Diſtance, there may be ſome interruption in the Regular Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Government, but to think that the Throne it ſelf can be vacant is abſurd, unleſs you will call it vacant when the King is nor actually upon it, in which Senſe I grant there is a Vacancy every Day. Having thus declared the Throne to be vacant, (which was the ſame thing as if they had ſet up this Bill over their Door, <hi>Here are three Kingdoms to be Let, Enquire within and you may be further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi>) the next thing they did was the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an humble Tender or Proffer of them to the Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi> which they, of their great Goodneſs and Condeſcention, were moſt graciouſly pleaſed to accept of.

You cannot well be ignorant of what I mean; the breaches they have made in the Royal Line, and the Caſe they have taken to defraud the Right Heir, being plain enough to be ſeen: <hi>Firſt,</hi> in ſetting aſide the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and all that happen to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend of him. to make way for the Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi> And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> In ſettling the Crown upon the Prince her Husband, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly during her Life, but alſo during his own, however long he may happen to ſurvive her, which is evidently to the Prejudice of the Princeſs <hi>Anne</hi> and her Heirs.

But in good earneſt, is it now come to that, that the aboliſhing of Epiſcopacy is become a neceſſary Means for the Preſervation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? If ſo, it is time for our Biſhops to look to themſelves, for I ſuppoſe it is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Conjecture to affirm that what is thought a neceſſary Expedient for the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Religion in one pace, may in time be judged to be proper in another.</p>

               <p>What was done in <hi>Scotland</hi> in aboliſhing Epiſcopacy and ſetting up Presbytery, was not by an Arbitrary Power aſſumed by the King himſelf, but by Act of Parliament, and at the Requeſt of the generality of the Nation; and therefore if there was any thing amiſs in it, it is not to be imputed to him.

It is likewiſe true, that King <hi>James</hi> by ſuſpending the Penal Laws turn'd looſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her the whole Herd of Diſſenrers, who like the <hi>Canaanites</hi> to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were as Thorns in her Sides; and ha not your King done the ſame? He nor only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the ſame Toleration which K. <hi>James</hi> which was ſo much cryed out againſt for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but has ſince enacted it by a Law; ſo that now the Sectaries are in the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or ſtand upon the ſame Foundation, with the Church of <hi>England.</hi> In a word, the three grand Enemies of our Church are <hi>Popery, Phanaticiſm and Atheiſm.</hi> If the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment has taken any effectual Courſe to preſerve her from theſe three, I grant ſhe is very much beholding to it. But whoever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires into it will find the Caſe very much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: For the Heat of their Zeal to ſecure her from the firſt, has ſo far tranſported them, that they have leſt her quite open to the other two, to prey upon her at their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. As for the Phanaticks, I have for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years look'd upon them as more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Enemies to the Church of <hi>England</hi> than the Papiſts themſelves are; equally irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, but much more reſtleſs and ſpightful. And if ſomtimes ſhe has ſcarce found her ſelf ſafe from their Inſults, or ſecure from their Incurſions, notwithſtanding their being fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced off by Penal Laws, ſhe muſt be in much greater danger of being over-run by them now that Hedge is broken down. And as for Atheiſm, what a Door has been opened to that by the late Revolution, and what Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have thronged in at it, does but too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear; which (however reproachful to Religion, or however grievous to all good Men, yet) is not much to be wondered at: For, alas! when Men that are otherwiſe not wery well grounded in Religion ſee it abuſed to ſuch ill Purpoſes, even to cloak the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Crimes: When they ſee Children uſurp their Father's Crown, and force him for the Safety of his Life to ſeek ſhelter among Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: When inſtead of oppoſing it, they ſee the whole Clergy of a National Church chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſuch an unnatural Villainy, pray for the Succeſs and Continuance of it, father it upon Divine Providence, and crave God Almight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's Protection to it, and all thoſe turned out to ſtarve or beg their Bread that refuſe to join with them in it: I ſay, when Men that are otherwiſe not very well grounded in Religion, ſee it proſtituted and abuſed to ſuch vile Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, by thoſe who pretend to be the moſt zealous Profeſſours of it, how can it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be expected but that they will conclude, that all Religion is a Trick. Thus have you laid ſuch a S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>umbling-Block in the Way, as has undoubtedly occaſioned the Fall of ſome Thouſands, who might otherwiſe have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good Chriſtians, and ſo far hardened them againſt oil belief of Religion, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to perſuade them that you your ſelves believe it: And though I grant that will not be ſufficient to excuſe them, yet I muſt tell you it will fall heavy upon thoſe that were the Occaſion of it.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61752:28"/>we that fight for them, and by that means ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them in that very Trade and Commerce whereof they have baſely ſupplanted us: Yet even in that we may aſſure our ſelves nothing will be done without the Conſent and Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the great Council of the Nation It is likewiſe neceſſary, that there ſhould be a general Pardon or Act of Oblivion, by which all Perſons may be ſufficiently aſſured. that they ſhall not be called to an account for what they have hitherto done againſt their King, or at leaſt if any be excepted out of it, that they be but very few, and they expreſly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. In the next place, that there be good Proviſion made for the Security of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and then laſtly, that in the Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Government for the future, the King have a conſtant and exact Regard to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Laws of the Land, contenting himſelf with that Prerogative which thoſe Laws allow him, and carefully avoiding all arbitrary and illegal Encroachments on the Liberties and Priviledges of the Subject, and all ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Innovations as were for merly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of.</p>
               <p>Theſe Things are all that can be ſuppoſed, neceſſary in order to put an end to our preſent Miſeries, and recover that happy and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Condition we formerly were in, and we may very confidently aſſure our ſelves that the reſtoring of King <hi>James</hi> after the ſame manner I have mentioned will accompliſh them all. I muſt confeſs I ſee no reaſon why we ſhould have the leaſt doubt of any of them but only this, that we have very ill deſerv'd them; but as that has been no Bar or Obstacle in other caſes of the like nature, we have no reaſon to apprehend it will be any in this. If you ask me what is the ground of my Confidence, or what tolerable Security we can have for the performance of theſe Things, I anſwer we have all the Security that either in Modeſty can be demanded, or in Reaſon be expected. Some of theſe Things I have mentioned, namely our being eaſed of a great part of thoſe Taxes we now lye under, and either a well ſettled Peace, or a more advantageous and ſucceſsful War than that we are now engaged in, are ſo evidently dependent upon the Reſtoration of our King, that if you do but ſuppoſe the one you cannot reaſonably entertain any doubt of the other: And as for the other Things men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, namely a General Pardon, the ſecuring of our Religion and governing according to Law, you very well know that by moſt ſolemn and frequently repeated Promiſes and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations in his ſeveral Declarations he has given us all the aſſurance of theſe Things that in the preſent State of his Affairs he is capable to give; nay more than that, if more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> be, he offers to give us all reaſonable Security of it that we our Selves can demand. Perhaps you will ſay, that conſidering his preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, you cannot ſafely rely upon any of his Promiſes nor any other Security he can give, Well, allowing it were ſo, (which ver I muſt tell you is extreamly diſingenuous in any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> partly becauſe if ever he did break his Promiſe to us formerly, it was far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any ſuch degree as you have pretended; and partly becauſe every Man who at any one time is not altogether ſo good as his Word. is not therefore to be thought unworthy of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit for ever after, unleſs you would baniſh all manner of Credit out of tho World.

                  </gap> that is, that all King <hi>James</hi>'s Promiſes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations can give us no tolerable Aſſurance of theſe Things, yet I ſtill contend that it is the moſt unreaſonable Thing in the World for any, Man to diſtruſt the performance of them: And my Reaſon is, becauſe, if we ſeriouſly and impartially conſider Things, we ſhall find that beſides the Obligation he lays upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his Promiſes for the Performance of theſe Things, there is ſuch an indiſpenſable Obligation ariſing from the nature of the Things themſelves, that we cannot ſo much as ſuppoſe that he will neglect the Performance of them, without believing at the ſame time, that he is more than mad or the moſt infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of all Men living. He knows too well what his former Remiſſneſs in theſe Things has coſt him, to be guilty of the ſame again. The Trips and falſe Steps he formerly made in the Adminiſtration of the Government have been ſo fatal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61752:28"/>But there is yet one Conſideration more, 'which with all unprejudic'd Perſons will put this matter beyond all Diſpute, and that is, that he is now grown ſo old, and by Croſſes and Misfortunes ſo far worn out, that it is rather a wonder that he has lived ſo long, than any ways probable that he can live much longer, and that he leaves a young Prince to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him whom he loves with the greateſt Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs imaginable, and for whoſe Settlement he would gladly make ſome laſting Proviſion, even at the expence of all that is moſt dear to him: And ſince that cannot otherwiſe be done but by a faithful and exact Performance of all theſe Things I have mentioned, and indeed of every Thing that can bind and oblige us, How can any Man doubt of the Sincerity of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions? Having ſo dear a Pledge for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his Promiſes, what greater Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity could we wiſh? He cannot chooſe but know, that if he ſhould break thoſe ſolemn Promiſes he now makes us, by violently inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding either our Religion or our Laws, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he himſelf might evade the Reſentment of his ſo groſly abuſed Subjects, it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to prevent it's falling heavy upon that innocent Prince that ſucceeds him. And therefore being his chiefeſt Care is to provide for his Safety, and eſtabliſh his Right, and that he himſelf cannot expect to live ſo long as to ſee him in a Capacity to maintain it, but muſt of neceſſity entruſt him to the Fidelity and Affection of his Subjects; we may confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently aſſure our ſelves he will be very tender of doing any thing that may reaſonably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige them. All that can be replyed to this is, that this Conſideration ought to have had the ſame Influence upon him formerly, which yet we ſee it had not: To which I anſwer that formerly he did not imagine that ſuch light Eſcapes could have ſo far exaſperated his Subjects, as to cauſe ſuch a general Revolt and Rebellion againſt him, but now he is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſenſible of it, and conſequently however little Influence it might have upon him then, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> is but reaſonable to think it will have a great deal now. Indeed, had he never known by experience the Temper of his Subjects, how jealous they are of their Liberties and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and how apt to reſent the leaſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment upon them, even againſt their Kings, or had he none to ſucceed him but thoſe that have diſoblig'd him, nor any thing to care for after his Deceaſe, you might have ſome pretence for your Diſtruſt. But you ſee the Caſe is very much otherwiſe. He knows what he has to truſt to if he ſhould treat us otherwiſe than well, he entru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
